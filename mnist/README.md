# Solving MNIST Using TensorFlow

I started using the [beginner](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/beginners/) tutorial.


These steps more like what I did rather than what should be done! Also some notes along with it.


Steps:

1. Get the MNIST [data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
  - It is a dataset of handwritten digits, and has been processed to fit in 28x28 pixel box
  - It combines census bureau employees and high schoolers data.
  - Training vs testing writers are disjoint
  -
